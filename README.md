# rotationTrees

Forests are both very flexible in terms of parametrisation and quite odd when looking at the topologies on which they rely,
especially when trying to spot outliers. This projects intends to approximate decision functions of SVMs, at a lesser
computationnal expense. It also aims at being scikit-learn compatible.
The project basically relies on :
- Liu, Fei Tony, Ting, Kai Ming and Zhou, Zhi-Hua. “Isolation forest.” Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, 2008 ;
- Rodriguez, J.J., Kuncheva, L.I..  "Rotation forest:  A new classifier ensemble method".  IEEETrans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., 2006.
